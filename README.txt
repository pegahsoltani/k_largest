Running program's instruction:
In order to run the instruction you should provide the k value which is the k largest number as the first parameter and the N value which is the number of of input files as the second instruction. Please note that this program cannot find more than one greates value in n files. So always write 1 instead of k. I was not able to write the result of each output child in the parent and give the sorted version of each child process. This program is able to create n child processes processing n input values each and find the greates number in each of the input files. You can run the code using make.
